1. **Random Quotes**:
   - The JavaScript file for this application orchestrates fetching and displaying quotes. It employs functions like `getRandomQuote()` to retrieve random quotes from the Forismatic API via a CORS proxy, displaying them on the webpage with `displayQuote()`. Users can also search for quotes using `searchQuote()`, which communicates with the Forismatic API based on user input and updates the webpage accordingly with `displaySearchResults()`. By utilizing the CORS proxy, it bypasses restrictions imposed by the Forismatic API, allowing seamless communication between the application and the API to provide users with random quotes or specific search results based on author or keyword queries.

2. **real-time Weather**:
   - This HTML-based Weather App provides users with a straightforward interface to fetch current weather data for a specific city or zip code. Styled for clarity and simplicity, the app features an input field for user input, a button to trigger the weather fetch process, and a designated area to display the retrieved weather information. The accompanying JavaScript file dynamically constructs API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input, parses the JSON response, and updates the webpage with the weather details or notifies the user if the city is not found. In essence, this Weather App streamlines the process of accessing real-time weather information, enhancing user convenience and experience.
